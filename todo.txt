Key Exchange: Securely exchange encryption keys between peers. Never send keys in plaintext over the network. Use a secure channel or a key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, libsodium's key exchange functions).

Authenticated Encryption: Use authenticated encryption (e.g., libsodium's crypto_secretbox_easy or crypto_box_easy) to ensure both confidentiality and integrity. This prevents tampering and eavesdropping.

Nonce Management: Always use a unique nonce for each message. Never reuse nonces with the same key.

Replay Protection: Optionally, implement replay protection (e.g., sequence numbers or timestamps) to prevent attackers from resending old messages.

Key Rotation: Periodically rotate keys if the session is long-lived.
